# web responsive

Responsive web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
I also use bootstrap for responsive structures or styles and for grid models.
use of @media query in body tag to personalize for making it responsive.
use of viewport for ensure readability as text columns grow wider.

I have completed this project0 as per given instruction.
